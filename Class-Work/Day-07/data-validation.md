## 🧾 Types of Form Validation
1. **Client-side Validation**  
   - Done in the browser before sending data to the server.  
   - Fast and gives instant feedback to the user.  

2. **Server-side Validation**  
   - Done on the server after form submission.  
   - More secure and ensures data integrity.
