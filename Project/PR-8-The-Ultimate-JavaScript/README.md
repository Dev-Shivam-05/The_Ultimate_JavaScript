## 🎯 Key Concepts Demonstrated

This repository is a deep dive into the four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming, with practical, executable examples for each.

| Concept       | Description                                                                 |
| :------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✔️ **Abstraction**  | Hiding complex reality while exposing only the essential parts.             |
| ✔️ **Inheritance**  | Creating new classes from existing ones to enable code reuse.               |
| ✔️ **Polymorphism**| Allowing objects of different classes to be treated as common super class.  |
| ✔️ **Encapsulation**| Bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit.   |

> #### Output
> ```text
> hello From Class A
> hello From Class B
> ```
</details>
<details>
<summary><code>/Inheritance Programs/Multi Level Inheritance/script.js</code></summary>

> #### Description
> Demonstrates a chain of inheritance (e.g., C -> B -> A), where a class derives from another derived class.
> #### Output
> ```text
> Dog is Barking..Bow Bow....
> monkey is Dancing.....

>
>         **Name**: Shivam Bhadoriya  
>         **Class**: 12  
>         **Total Marks**: 500

</details>

### 🔹 Polymorphism & Encapsulation
<details>
<summary><code>/PolyMorphism Programs/overloading.js</code></summary>

> #### Description

> #### Output
> ```text
> Hello from Parent.
> Hello from Child A.

> Hello From Child B.
> ```
</details>
<details>
<summary><code>/PolyMorphism Programs/SetterAndGetter.js</code></summary>

> #### Description
> A clear demonstration of **Encapsulation** using Getters and Setters to control access to an object's private data, ensuring data integrity.
> #### Output
> ```text
> Your Name Is :- Shivam Bhadoriya
> ```
</details>
<details>
<summary><code>/PolyMorphism Programs/static.js</code></summary>

> #### Description
> Illustrates a `static` method, a utility function that belongs to the class itself rather than to any instance.
> #### Output
