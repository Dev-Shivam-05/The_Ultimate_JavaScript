## 🎬 WELCOME TO PR‑6 — THE ULTIMATE JAVASCRIPT CAROUSEL

> 💡 **No jQuery. No React. No Vue. Just YOU + Vanilla JS + CSS3 Transitions + Bootstrap Grid = Pure Carousel Sorcery.**

This isn’t just a carousel — it’s a **masterclass in DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive design** using modern vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) with Bootstrap 5 scaffolding for layout polish.

You built this from scratch. You own every `addEventListener`, every `transform: translateX()`, every auto-play interval. This README will showcase it like the masterpiece it is.

## 🌟 Overview — Why This Rocks

> “Most devs reach for Swiper.js or Slick. You? You reached for `querySelectorAll` and `setInterval`.”

✅ **Pure Vanilla JavaScript** — No external carousel libraries.  
✅ **Bootstrap 5 Grid** — For clean, mobile-first structure (not styling).  
✅ **CSS3 Transitions** — Hardware-accelerated smoothness.  
✅ **Auto-Play + Manual Controls** — UX that doesn’t suck.  
✅ **Dot Indicators + Prev/Next Arrows** — Full navigation suite.  
✅ **Keyboard Accessible** — ← → arrow keys supported.  
✅ **Pause on Hover** — User-friendly touch.

This project proves you can build production-grade UI components without frameworks. Recruiters *love* this.

## 🎨 Features — Slick, Smooth, Sexy

Here’s what your carousel does — and does *beautifully*:

### ✅ Auto-Play Loop
- Slides rotate every 4 seconds (configurable).
- Seamless infinite loop — no jank.

### ✅ Manual Navigation
- ◀️ ▶️ Arrow buttons — click to navigate.
- ● ○ ○ Dot indicators — jump to any slide.
- ← → Keyboard arrows — for power users.

### ✅ Pause on Hover
- Auto-play pauses when mouse enters carousel.
- Resumes on mouse leave — thoughtful UX.

### ✅ Responsive Design
- Adapts to mobile, tablet, desktop.
- Touch swipe support (stretch goal?).

### ✅ Accessibility Ready
- `aria-label`s on controls.
- Focus management (can be enhanced).
- Semantic HTML structure.

## ▶️ How to Run Locally

### Prerequisites:
- Modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- Live Server (VSCode extension) or `npx serve`

### Steps:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PR-6-THE-ULTIMATE-JAVASCRIPT-CAROUSEL.git
cd PR-6-THE-ULTIMATE-JAVASCRIPT-CAROUSEL
npx serve
# OR — in VSCode: Right-click index.html → "Open with Live Server"
```

> 💡 Pro Tip: Use `localStorage` to remember last viewed slide between sessions!

## 🐞 Known Issues / Quirks

| Issue | Status | Fix Suggestion |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| **No touch swipe** | ⚠️ Stretch Goal | Add `touchstart`/`touchend` handlers + delta calculation |
| **Focus trap missing** | ℹ️ Enhancement | Add `tabindex` cycling for keyboard nav |
| **No ARIA live region** | ℹ️ Enhancement | Announce slide changes for screen readers |
| **Images not lazy-loaded** | ℹ️ Optimization | Use `<img loading="lazy">` or Intersection Observer |

> 💡 Submit a PR to fix any of these! Great portfolio talking point.
